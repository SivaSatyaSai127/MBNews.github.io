                    <p>Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/mango-exploiter-gets-liquidated-after-roiling-aave-using-20m-of-borrowed-curve-tokens/"style="text-decoration: none"><span style="color:green">“highly profitable trading strategy”</span></a> drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/"style="text-decoration: none"><span style="color:green">decentralized-finance </span></a> trading platform.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629/gov.uscourts.nysd.591629.1.0.pdf"style="text-decoration: none"><span style="color:green">filing unsealed Tuesday</span></a>. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.
                        A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and knowingly” manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.
                        “Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”</p>
